# Snake-game
That is a Snake game similar to the classic game. After the game starts, the snake moves to the right, but we can control it with arrows: up, down, left and right, to collect points. When the snake collect points, it increases its length. If the snake hits a wall or hits itself due to its length, the game will end, but can be restart. The points thus collected are stored in the  score section.
